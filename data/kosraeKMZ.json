The original data were developed by the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) as part of the \"Geospatial Information Development and Application to Support Effective Decision Making in the Federated States of Micronesia\" project conducted in partnership with Island Research & Education Initiative (iREi) and College of Micronesia (COM), with funding from NOAA - Coastal Storms Program. The data were incorporated into PDC's DisasterAWARE decision-support system (2014). Island Research & Education Initiative (iREi) (2019) extracted a subset from the original dataset and formatted it for use in this atlas. The features were updated using feedback from Kosrae Island Resource Management Authority (KIRMA), which distinguished between the formal landfill and the closed sites.",
