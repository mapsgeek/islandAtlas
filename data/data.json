The locations are approximate and none were verified in the field. Along with the location, we noted the approximate directions of the caves' openings, as marked on the topographic maps. It should be noted that high islands of Chuuk Lagoon have no karst terrain, so all caves found there are in volcanic units. They include both natural caves (lava tubes and cliff-base rock shelters) and human-made caves (mostly excavated for defensive purposes by the Japanese military during World War II).",

      "decription": "This map shows the locations of a significant part of Japanese military and World War II legacy scattered around the islands of Chuuk Lagoon. The features shown are remains of military bases, command centers, runways, storage areas, artillery sites, bunkers, port facilities, seaplane sites, and other war paraphernalia located on land, as opposed to sunken ships and other underwater features. The data layer was created by Island Research & Education Initiative (iREi) (2020) by compiling location information from a number of sources, including Geoview and years of research (2001-2008) by William Jeffery (University of Guam) and fieldwork implemented with Arimichy Rudolph and Anerit Mailo of Chuuk State Historic Preservation Office (Chuuk SHPO), in collaboration with many people in Chuuk, including Gradvin Aisek, Tong Misa, and the other chiefs of Tonoas, informant and translator Joshua Suka, landowners and residents of Tonoas and Weno, and the US National Park Service / Historic Preservation Fund.",
